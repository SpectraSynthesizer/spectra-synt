# Spectra Synthesizer
This repository contains the code of the GR(1) synthesizer, which is based on the Spectra specification language that can be found in `spectra-lang` repository.

## Installation
The synthesizer and its tools are developed over the Eclipse framework, therefore a working installation of Eclipse (preferably version above or equals 2019-03) is a prerequisite.

To download a packaged version of Eclipse with spectra tools installed, go to http://smlab.cs.tau.ac.il/syntech/spectra/index.html.
We provide also an update site to install updates with the following link: `http://smlab.cs.tau.ac.il/syntech/spectra/tools/update/`.

In order to compile Spectra synthesizer from source code:
- `git clone` this repository into your computer, along with `spectra-lang`.
- Import all existing projects from both repositories into an Eclipse workspace.
- Build Spectra lanugage auto generated code by right click on `src/tau.smlab.syntech.GenerateSpectra.mwe2` and then 'Run As -> MWE2 Workflow`.
- Run project by creating a new `Eclipse Application` configuration in `Run Configurations` window.
